jmetergraphs
============

Agregates a number of jmeter log files and produces graphs. Useful when automating jmeter tests across multiple hosts.

Forking some code I updated several years ago.

The original perl script by Christoph Meissner was found here:
http://wiki.apache.org/jmeter/LogAnalysis

I integrated a fix from mhardy@tkdevvm (Mike Hardy?) and added functionality to produce an index.html allowing you to view the graphs.

I would like to make this a bit more comprehensive potentially by wrapping the graphs with click throughs, producing rrd files or the like.
